# 🚀 Learn Machine Learning by Doing  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Journey Repository**! 🎉  
I’ve just started learning ML using the amazing [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSi-nLQ4XV2Mds8Z7bihK68L&si=lp06pjlyGgRWeecj) and decided to follow a **learn by doing** approach.  

This repo will serve as:  
- 📒 A collection of my notes and code.  
- 🧪 Practical implementations of ML concepts.  
- 🤝 A way to collaborate and encourage others to learn alongside me.

## 🌱 Why this Repository?  
Machine Learning can look intimidating at first, but the best way to **truly understand** it is by:  
1. **Practicing hands-on** with small projects.  
2. **Breaking down concepts** into simple steps.  
3. **Sharing knowledge** with a community.

## 🙌 Let’s Learn Together!  
I believe **learning in public** is the fastest way to grow. This repo is not about perfection but about **progress**.  
If you’re also starting your ML journey, don’t just watch tutorials—**code along, experiment, and share!**
